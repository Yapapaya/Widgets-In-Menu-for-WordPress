== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*The widgets show up, but the display is all messed up.*

That's because the css for the nav menu was never meant to take care of widgets.

For example, if the widget contains a link, you might have to redo it. If it's a calendar:

`.yawp_wim_wrap a {
width: auto !important;
padding: 0 !important;
}`

*How does one style the widgets?*

Inspect element is your friend. Otherwise, the menu item will have the classes *menu-item-type-yawp_wim*, *menu-item-object-yawp_wim*.

Additionally, the widget will be wrapped in a div with the class *yawp_wim_wrap*.

Using these selectors, one can style the widgets.

Also, using various filters (see: Other Notes), especially *yawp_wim_attribute_prefix*, you can change this *yawp_wim* prefix to something of your own:

`add_filter('yawp_wim_attribute_prefix','my_prefix');

function my_prefix($default_prefix){
    return 'my_prefix';
}`

The wrapper class will now be *my_prefix_wrap* and so on.

*How does one use the plugin?*
